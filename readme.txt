# Portfolio — Static Prototype

This repository contains a static prototype of Yash Verma's portfolio site based on the shared Figma concept. It includes all primary screens (Home, About, Projects, Contact) and interconnected navigation/CTA buttons so the experience can be reviewed end-to-end before polishing content and visuals.

## Structure

- `index.html` – landing page with hero, services, work preview, testimonials, and CTA.
- `about.html` – biography, values, awards, and CTA.
- `projects.html` – detailed case studies, design process, and CTA.
- `contact.html` – contact form, FAQs, and newsletter signup block.
- `styles.css` – shared visual styles, layout, and responsive rules.
- `scripts.js` – mobile navigation toggle behaviour.
- `assets/Yash-Verma-Resume.pdf` – placeholder document linked from the contact page.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the prototype. All buttons and navigation links connect to the respective pages.

When you're ready to integrate the real content, replace the placeholder copy and update the resume PDF with the final version.
